This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to unhandled exceptions within event listeners.  The bug.html file contains an event listener that, while seemingly simple, can fail silently if an error occurs within the listener's callback function. The solution.html provides a corrected version.  This scenario is often missed during development, highlighting the need for robust error handling in JavaScript event listeners within HTML.
